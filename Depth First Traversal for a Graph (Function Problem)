/*
Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function would be added by GfG's Online Judge.*/


/* You have to complete this function
which prints out the depth first level traversal of the 
graph starting from node s
the vector<int> g[i] represent the adjacency 
list of the ith node of the graph
