Solution C++


/*
Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function would be added by GfG's Online Judge.*/


/* A binary tree node has data, pointer to left child
   and a pointer to right child /
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
}; */
// Recursive function to print right view of a binary tree.
void printKdistance(Node *root, int k)
{
    if(root==NULL)
