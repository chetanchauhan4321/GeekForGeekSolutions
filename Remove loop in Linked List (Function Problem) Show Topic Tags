/*
Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function would be added by GfG's Online Judge.*/


/*The structure of linked list is the following
struct Node
{
int data;
Node* next; 
};*/
/*The function removes the loop from the linked list if present
You are required to complete this method*/
